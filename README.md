## Logfly65

Number 65 for version 6.5 of Logfly. Evolution of version 6 to bring Logfly into compliance with the latest Electron standards:

* only load secure content
* disable the Node.js integration in all renderers that display remote content
* enable context isolation in all renderers

**This is not a functional program**, just a test. For now, continue to use version 6.
